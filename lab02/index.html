        <p><i>Published on September 10 by Jacob Bontuyan</i></p>

        <p>This was a fun lab. I got to learn more about HTML with the usage of tags
            and the structuring of websites.<br>
            I also appreciate that we get to have hands-on experience with the structure of HTML. <br>
            Looking forward to learning more advanced HTML, and then CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h3>New Things I Learned</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Structure of websites and structural elements like header, main, article, and section.</li>
            <li>How to hyperlink using href and the < a > anchortag.</li>
            <li>There are 3 types of lists in HTML, unordered, ordered, and definition.</li>
        </ol>

            <p>Learning about HTML website structure was exciting. These are two of the songs that I listened to to help me focus:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Neighborhood - Marc Russo</li>
                <li>Don't Know Why - Norah Jones</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I listened to these songs here on <a href="https://music.youtube.com/">Youtube Music</a>.</a></p>
