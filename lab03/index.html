        <h2>Lab 2</h2>

        <p><i>Published on September 10 by Jacob Bontuyan</i></p>

        <p id="para1" class="para">This was a fun lab. I got to learn more about HTML with the usage of tags
            and the structuring of websites.
            I also appreciate that we get to have hands-on experience with the structure of HTML. 
            Looking forward to learning more advanced HTML, and then CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h3>New Things I Learned</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Structure of websites and structural elements like header, main, article, and section.</li>
            <li>How to hyperlink using href and the < a > anchortag.</li>
            <li>There are 3 types of lists in HTML, unordered, ordered, and definition.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <article>
            <p>Learning about HTML website structure was exciting. These are two of the songs that I listened to to help me focus:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Neighborhood - Marc Russo</li>
                <li>Don't Know Why - Norah Jones</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I listened to these songs here on <a href="https://music.youtube.com/">Youtube Music</a></a></p>

        <h2> Things I Learned After Lab 3</h2>
        <p><i>Published on September 22 by Jacob Bontuyan</i></p>
        <p id="para2" class="para">After completing Lab and Module 3, I am more capable of creating a website of my own. I learned the basics of CSS, and am now able to design the webpages I make using basic designs 
            on the text. I am able to color the background of the webpage, color the text, add borders, margins, and paddings as well. I am also now able to design hyperlinks, so that they have a 
            small basic animation. Overall, I am pleased with the work I've done and with the material I've learned, and hope to progress more.
