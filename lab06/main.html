    <p>This website's target audience is the modding community of the game Skyrim by Bethesda.</p>
    
    <h2>Review of the Website</h2>

    <p>This site is organized so that users can get where they need to immediately, whether it be to navigate to one
        of the community's games, or to log in to their account, or to access the community and support resources.
        The good thing about this website is that from the starting/home page, it takes only 1 click to get where you
        really need to be.
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of the CRAP Design Principle, this site uses the proximity principle very well. In the list
        of mods, it puts all of the games next to each other, where the main focus is. It would have been very confusing
        if some games were at one place and other games were at a completely different place.

    <h3>Effectiveness</h3>
    
    <p>The website is effective in the sense that it gets its goal accomplished, giving users an easy time navigating through
        the website's mods and games to add to their collection.
    </p>

    <h3>Efficiency</h3>
    <p>The website, however, is not very efficient. With all of the ads and cookies in place, it can take quite long to
        complete user requests and clicks.
    </p>

    <h3>Engagement</h3>
    <p>The platform is pleasant to use. The user gets what they need and can navigate through where they want to go very easily.
        But sometimes the ads and cookies can be a hindrance. 
    </p>

    <h3>One Recommendation</h3>
    <p>One recommendation I have for the website is to get rid of all the ads. It ruins the first principle of CRAP, which is contrast.
        The website should be easy looking on the eyes. With all these ads, it can be an eyesore for some.
    </p>
