                Hello, my name is Jacob. I love to play basketball, spend time with my dog, and spend time outdoors in natural scenery.
                I also enjoy playing video games, learning new things, and reading. I would like to develop more hobbies
                 in the future.

            <p>

                I already said my hobbies at the first section, but some more hobbies I would like to develop more 
                are reading more consistently and swimming. Some skills I have are computer skills, video and photo editing, and
                I can also cook a little bit.
