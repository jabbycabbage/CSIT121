            This final project I estimate it took me 9 hours to complete in total, including the planning and 
            brainstorming as much as the actual coding. This makes it one of the most time-consuming projects I've had. It made me realize a few things. Firstly, if I can spend 9
            hours on this project, then surely I can create something pretty worthwhile if I spend 9 hours or more doing the 
            same thing, creating a website. I was able to use my resources well, especially online tools. What I used were my
            skills and knowledge of the languages, and just researched if my ideas were possible. W3schools was a great help in giving me the help in turning my 
            ideas into reality.

            In testing on multiple browsers and devices, I realized how difficult Web Development actually
            can be. To provide the best experience possible for everyone is a challenge. You really need to be
            knowledgeable on the technologies that you are using and even on emerging technologies as well. It is
            difficult in particular to provide an experience for everyone because when creating a media query for different
            screen sizes, you might need to add code to the existing HTML file, and maybe even remove some if it is not
            compatible with what you are trying to do. So it is also important that before you start, you should have
            a plan.

            Going forward, I am interested in taking the course for JavaScript that CCBC offers here. If being proficient
            in Web Development is a strong skill to have as a programmer, then I would like to add that to my toolbelt. This course
            was a good stepping stone for programming in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it surely built a good foundation for my continuous
            learning.
