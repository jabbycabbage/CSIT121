        <h2>Page 3 - Building Upon Skills</h2>
        <p>Eventually, I was able to build upon the skills and knowledge acquired by expanding my knowledge on HTML & CSS,
            and then using my gained knowledge to learn JavaScript, a more advanced form of programming for websites. I was also able
            to learn what XML was, and how to use it, gaining valuable knowledge.

        <h3><a href="https://jabbycabbage.github.io/CSIT121/lab05/index.html" target="_blank" class="link">Lab 05</a></h3>
        <p>For this assignment, we built upon a previous website (Lab 4), using our newly gained knowledge to fix any
            issues it had and to apply better styling. In this lab, I also learned the concept of responsiveness. This particular website
            has 3 media queries, allowing for 3 different versions depending on device.

        <p>
            This wasn't submitted, but it was part of the discussion activity for the JavaScript module.
            Through this practice activity, I learned more about JavaScript. This program in particular, I really wanted
            to learn more about JavaScript, so I wrote all of the code instead of copying and pasting. Having previous
            experience with Java, I was able to understand some of the logic, however some of the syntax still left me
            wondering.
